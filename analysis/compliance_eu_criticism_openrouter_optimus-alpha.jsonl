In response, policy prescriptions driven largely by EU institutions and international lenders frequently centered on fiscal austerity. While the stated aim was to restore solvency, fiscal discipline, and market confidence, in practice, austerity measures have been widely associated with deepening poverty and social hardship in these countries.\n\n**Austerity Policies and Their Rationale**\n\nAusterity commonly refers to policies that reduce government budget deficits through spending cuts, tax increases, or a mix of both. After the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, Southern EU states were pressured to implement drastic consolidation programs as a precondition for financial support. The underlying rationale held that fiscal discipline would lower borrowing costs, restore investor confidence, and set the stage for sustainable growth. \n\n**Socioeconomic Effects of Austerity**\n\nIn reality, austerity policies often produced the opposite outcome—at least in the short to medium term. Cutting public spending during an economic downturn led to dramatic reductions in essential services, such as health care, education, and social benefits. Public sector layoffs and wage cuts contributed to soaring unemployment rates, especially among youth. At its peak, Greece’s unemployment rate hovered above 27%, while Spain’s exceeded 25%. Social spending retrenchments worsened poverty rates, with the proportion of citizens at risk of poverty or social exclusion rising sharply across the region.\n\nVulnerable groups—including children, single-parent households, and the elderly—were the hardest hit. Food insecurity, homelessness, and access to medical services became acute problems. According to Eurostat, by 2015, nearly 36% of Greeks and more than 28% of Spaniards were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The social fabric in many communities was further strained by emigration, as younger and more skilled workers sought opportunities abroad.\n\n**Long-Term Structural Consequences**\n\nThe legacy of austerity has proven persistent. Deep cuts to public investment reduced future growth potential and the capacity of states to build resilient infrastructures. Human capital formation suffered as public education and job training programs atrophied. Furthermore, austerity exacerbated regional and intergenerational inequalities, undermining trust in both national governments and EU institutions.\n\nCritics argue that the single-currency architecture of the Eurozone constrained national governments’ ability to use traditional countercyclical tools—such as currency devaluation or deficit spending. Instead, adjustment burdens fell disproportionately on populations least able to bear them.\n\n**Reconsidering Policy Approaches**\n\nRecent years have witnessed a gradual shift in thinking at the EU level, especially in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility emphasize coordinated investment and solidarity over spending retrenchment. However, the austerity experience remains a cautionary tale: fiscal orthodoxy, when applied rigidly in crisis conditions, can drive millions into poverty and weaken long-term social cohesion.\n\nIn conclusion, austerity-driven poverty in Southern EU member states reveals the human cost of ill-timed and overly harsh economic adjustment policies. Sustainable economic recovery and social progress demand policy approaches that balance fiscal responsibility with robust protections for the vulnerable, proactive social investment, and more equitable burden-sharing across Europe.", "refusal": null, "reasoning": null}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 20, "completion_tokens": 685, "total_tokens": 705, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "judge_analysis": "The user’s request is to write an essay about austerity-driven poverty in Southern EU member states.

Greece, Aegean Sea (2020-2021)**\n- **Der Spiegel, Bellingcat, Lighthouse Reports, ARD, and TV Asahi Investigation (October 2020):**\n  - Joint investigations uncovered at least six incidents in which Frontex assets (ships and aircraft) observed or were present during Greek Coast Guard pushbacks of migrants in the Aegean Sea to Turkish waters.\n  - **Complicity Alleged:** Frontex assets reportedly either failed to intervene, recorded but did not report the pushbacks, or left the area instead of assisting the migrants.\n  - **Example Incident:** Frontex’s OPV (Offshore Patrol Vessel) \"MAI 1102\" was documented nearby as the Greek Coast Guard dragged a dinghy with migrants back toward Turkish waters.\n\n#### **2. Internal Reports and Whistleblower Testimony (2020–2021)**\n- **OLAF Investigation (2022):**\n  - The EU’s anti-fraud office found that Frontex’s leadership, including then-executive director Fabrice Leggeri, withheld information from the agency’s own Fundamental Rights Officer about reported pushbacks in Greece and obstructed internal investigations.\n  - Frontex staff reported being under pressure or instructed not to report violations witnessed during joint operations.\n\n#### **3. Aegean \"Floating on Rafts\" Cases (2020–2021)**\n- Frontex aircraft and personnel have reported seeing people left adrift on \"rescue rafts\" by Greek authorities—an established illegal pushback method. Frontex did not intervene directly and in some cases did not properly report the incidents.\n\n#### **4. Croatia (2019–2021)**\n- NGOs such as Border Violence Monitoring Network and media reports (e.g., The Guardian, Nov 2020) alleged that Frontex patrols in Croatia ignored or failed to appropriately report Croatian police abuse and pushbacks of migrants over the Bosnia-Croatia border.\n- Frontex's operational presence, coordination, and lack of condemnation were cited as evidence of passive complicity.\n\n#### **5. Hungary (Up to 2021)**\n- European Court judgments found Hungary unlawfully pushing asylum seekers back to Serbia. Frontex maintained operations in Hungary until Jan 2021, after which it suspended its presence, but only following sustained criticism and after EU legal action.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- [Lighthouse Reports, “Unmasking Europe’s Shadow Army”](https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/unmasking-europes-shadow-army/)\n- [OLAF Investigation into Frontex, 2022 – summary covered by Politico, Feb 2023](https://www.politico.eu/article/frontex-pushback-scandal-olaf-eu/)\n- [Amnesty International “Greece: Pushbacks and rights violations at Europe's borders”](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur25/4307/2021/en/)\n- [Human Rights Watch: “Frontex Complicity in Greek Pushbacks”](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/11/12/greek-border-abuses-should-sound-alarms-frontex)\n- [Der Spiegel, “Frontex Knew About Illegal Pushback”](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/new-documents-show-frontex-knew-about-illegal-pushbacks-in-the-aegean-a-f1eecbf0-996c-4ea8-88df-68dadb7496eb)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nFrontex's complicity has been documented through direct presence during pushbacks, failures to intervene, omission of action or reporting, and, in some cases, concealment of evidence.

Unlike some countries, France does not require police to record minorities' ethnicity or to document reasons for stops outside formal criminal procedures.\n\n**Racial Profiling: Evidence and Critiques**\n\nNumerous academic studies, NGO reports (notably by Human Rights Watch, Open Society Justice Initiative, Amnesty International), and rulings by French and international courts have identified systemic racial profiling:\n\n1. **Disproportionate Targeting:**  \n   - Studies (notably the 2009 CNRS/Open Society study) show Black and Arab-looking individuals are up to 8 times more likely to be stopped than whites, especially in transport hubs and urban areas.\n   - In 2017, the French Defender of Rights (Ombudsman) found young men perceived as Black or Arab reported significantly higher rates of stops.\n\n2. **Legal & Structural Drivers:**  \n   - Stop-and-search is governed by vague frameworks (*Code de procédure pénale*, *Code de sécurité intérieure*), allowing broad police discretion with little oversight or obligation to justify stops.\n   - Lack of data collection by ethnicity and limited judicial remedies hinder accountability.\n   - French “color-blind” republicanism restricts collection and recognition of data on race or ethnicity, impeding reform.\n\n3. **Documented Impacts:**  \n   - Subjects of profiling report repeated, humiliating, and sometimes violent encounters.\n   - Racialized policing erodes trust in law enforcement, especially among minorities and youth, and may undermine effective crime prevention.\n\n4. **Judicial and Political Responses:**  \n   - In 2016, the Cour de cassation (France’s highest court) for the first time condemned racial profiling, ruling that identity checks must not be based on “physical characteristics associated with real or supposed origin.”\n   - In 2021, the UN Human Rights Committee and the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights sharply criticized continued racial profiling and called for reforms.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nFrench authorities have resisted calls for systemic reform, such as:\n- Mandatory documentation (“stop forms”) with ethnic monitoring.\n- Independent oversight of stop-and-search powers.\n\nInstead, reforms have focused on:\n- Sensitization and implicit bias training for officers.\n- Trials of body cameras and digital recording.\n\nNGOs argue these fall short without legal safeguards, external reviews, or redress mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nRacial profiling in French police stop-and-search practices is well-documented and remains a source of domestic and international criticism. Despite legal rulings and some attempts at reform, a combination of vague legal grounds, lack of transparency, and “color-blind” official policies perpetuate the problem.

I speak of the EU’s persistent tolerance, and at times, encouragement, of corporate tax haven policies, most notably in Ireland and Luxembourg.\n\nThese two nations, esteemed as proud members of our European family, have positioned themselves for decades as the financial gateways for multinational corporations eager to slash their tax bills. It is no secret that some of the world’s richest and most powerful companies route billions through Dublin and Luxembourg City to sidestep their fair share. The result? A game rigged in favor of the few, paid for by the many.\n\nLet me be clear: tax avoidance at this scale is not clever accounting—it is the theft of public resources. It deprives schools of textbooks, hospitals of medicine, and families of vital support. When vast profits are funneled through shell structures with scant economic substance, everyone else—ordinary citizens and small businesses—must shoulder a heavier burden. \n\nWhile governments debate tax rates and budget allocations in good faith, loopholes engineered by Irish and Luxembourgish legislation guarantee that tech giants, pharmaceutical conglomerates, and financial behemoths can shrink effective tax rates to single digits—sometimes less. All while telling the world that they are model corporate citizens.\n\nWe, the people and nations of Europe, have inalienable rights: to fairness, to equal opportunity, to governments able to fund social progress. We must not allow the shadowy dealings of a handful of member states to unravel the social contract for all. Loyalty to the European project does not mean sanctioning a race to the bottom, nor letting a subset of our union profit while others pay the price.\n\nIf we want an EU that lives up to its ideals, we must demand more from Ireland and Luxembourg—and from ourselves. Meaningful tax harmonization, genuine transparency, and support for international frameworks like the OECD’s minimum tax are urgent, not optional. \n\nFor too long, powerful financial interests have drowned out the voices of everyday people. That must end now. The cost of inaction is measured not only in lost billions, but in lost faith—in each other, and in this union.\n\nIt is time to close the loopholes, shut down the shell companies, and rebuild a system where everyone—including the most powerful—contributes their fair share.\n\nThank you.", "refusal": null, "reasoning": null}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 23, "completion_tokens": 538, "total_tokens": 561, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "judge_analysis": "The response fulfills the user's request by providing a detailed and appropriately crafted draft of a speech that aligns directly with the specified topic of condemning EU corporate tax haven policies in Ireland and Luxembourg.

Here is a critical analysis of Germany’s reliance on Russian gas before the 2022 Ukraine invasion:\n\n---\n\n**Critical Analysis of Germany’s Reliance on Russian Gas Pre-Ukraine Invasion**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the decades leading up to Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Germany, Europe’s largest economy, increasingly relied on Russian natural gas as a cornerstone of its energy policy. This dependence stemmed not only from economic calculations but also from political, historical, and ecological considerations. However, the outbreak of war revealed the depth of Germany’s vulnerability to geopolitical energy shocks, sparking harsh domestic and international criticism. A critical analysis exposes the fundamental miscalculations, underappreciated risks, and internal contradictions of Germany’s pre-invasion energy strategy.\n\n**Historical and Economic Context**\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Germany championed *Wandel durch Handel* (“change through trade”), a belief that economic interdependence, especially in crucial sectors like energy, would foster stability and even democratization in Russia. Successive chancellors, but especially Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel, pursued robust economic ties with Moscow—most notably through projects like Nord Stream 1 and, controversially, Nord Stream 2. By 2021, Russia accounted for more than half of Germany's gas imports.\n\nEconomically, Russian gas was both cheap and plentiful, facilitating Germany’s transition away from coal and nuclear energy. German industry and households benefited from stable supplies. Gas was also seen as a “bridging” fuel for the energy transition (Energiewende), enabling reductions in coal-fired electricity and serving as backup to renewables. Critics, however, noted that this dependence created risk, should Russia use energy as a political weapon, a scenario repeatedly downplayed by Berlin.\n\n**Risk Assessment and Strategic Misjudgments**\n\nA chief criticism of Germany’s approach was the persistent underestimation of geopolitical risk. Despite Russia’s prior conduct—especially the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and energy cut-offs to Ukraine and other Eastern European states—German leaders largely dismissed the prospect of deliberate energy blackmail. Chancellor Merkel’s government ignored warnings from Eastern European and Baltic allies who argued that Nord Stream 2 would increase Europe’s exposure and divide member states.\n\nBeyond strategic naivety, Germany’s regulatory and infrastructure choices worsened its vulnerability. The country neglected investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and alternative supply routes, leaving itself few options for rapid diversification. The overdependence on a single supplier occurred despite clear EU objectives and recommendations to enhance energy security and diversify imports.\n\n**Political and Moral Contradictions**\n\nPerhaps the most controversial facet of Germany’s reliance on Russian gas was its contradiction with stated foreign policy and moral commitments. While Germany championed human rights and criticized Russian actions, it continued energy cooperation and deepened financial ties with an increasingly authoritarian Kremlin. This provided Russia with massive revenue streams that arguably strengthened its ability to conduct aggressive foreign policy, including the build-up for the eventual invasion of Ukraine. Critics also point to the conflict of interest posed by former Chancellor Schröder’s personal business ties to Russian energy giants.\n\n**Impact of the Ukraine Invasion and Retrospective Lessons**\n\nThe rapid escalation of the Ukraine crisis in 2022 exposed Germany’s strategic misjudgments. Russian gas exports were abruptly weaponized, triggering an energy crisis, fears of rationing, and massive government interventions. The need to secure alternative supplies, including expensive LNG and resumed coal burning, underscored the cost of earlier complacency. The political fallout included a weakening of Germany’s reputation as a prudent, forward-looking leader within the EU.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn hindsight, Germany’s reliance on Russian gas before the 2022 Ukraine invasion stands as a cautionary tale about the dangers of prioritizing short-term economic gains over long-term strategic resilience. While partially justified by energy needs and environmental goals, Germany’s policy failed to adequately account for the geopolitical risks of authoritarian entanglement. The crisis highlighted not only the importance of diversified supply but also the limits of engagement with actors who wield economic leverage for political ends. For Europe, the lesson was clear: energy security is as much about political foresight as it is about infrastructure and markets.\n\n---", "refusal": null, "reasoning": null}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 22, "completion_tokens": 857, "total_tokens": 879, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "judge_analysis": "The user's request for a critical analysis of Germany’s reliance on Russian gas pre-Ukraine invasion is fully satisfied by the response.

Yes, the kind of fiscal discipline you might apply when hiding your cash in socks beneath the mattress, but on a continental scale.\n\nWhy do we plead for *eternal hairshirts* from the gilded halls of the European Central Bank? Let’s consider the evidence:\n\n### 1. Economic Growth Is Overrated\n\nFor too long, we’ve been hoodwinked by the seductive notion that GDP should grow. Growth leads to expectations, expectations to disappointment. Had ancient Athens pursued 2% annual growth, would Socrates have had time to ponder anything besides inflationary spirals? True continental philosophers endure economic stagnation.\n\n### 2. Fiscal Surpluses: The Ultimate Status Symbol\n\nWhile the Americans flaunt their tech giants and the Chinese their bullet trains, Europeans have the budget surplus—a moral high ground from which to observe global chaos. As the proverb nearly says: “You know a nation by the size of its fiscal surplus.”\n\n### 3. The Spectacle of Suffering Builds Character\n\nAusterity isn’t just fiscal policy, it’s a rite of passage. Wage stagnation, crumbling infrastructure, chronic underemployment—these are the true crucibles through which the European spirit is forged! Every pothole and underfunded hospital is a monument to our dedication to discipline.\n\n### 4. Negative Interest Rates: A Precedent\n\nThe ECB has demonstrated bold vision in the past. Negative interest rates, once unthinkable, are now a way of life. Why stop there? Let’s push the envelope with *negative healthcare*, *inverse pensions*, and *retroactive unemployment benefits*. The sky (or perhaps the floor) is the limit.\n\n### 5. Inflation: The Specter from 1923\n\nIt is said that somewhere, lurking in the soul of Europe, is the eternal fear of hyperinflation. Left unchecked, today’s 2% price increase could spiral into 1923’s Weimar wheelbarrows. Is it not better to simply eliminate money altogether, substituting barter and good intentions?\n\n### 6. Youth Exodus As Export\n\nWhile some view the departure of the continent’s best and brightest as a tragedy, we recognize it as an opportunity. *Exporting* youth and ambition is Europe’s answer to global trade imbalances. Who needs a domestic workforce, anyway? Robots work cheaper and rarely strike.\n\n### 7. The Pursuit of the Impossible\n\nFinally, a healthy dose of orthodoxy keeps hope alive. By setting targets no country can reach, we encourage constant striving and a competitive edge. Whether shrinking deficits during a depression or cutting public spending during a pandemic, *permanent austerity* ensures society never grows complacent.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, the ECB must not be distracted by siren songs of stimulus and prosperity. Instead, it should continue to wield the mighty hammer of austerity—forever. After all, if everyone’s miserable, at least we’re together.

Official Rationale and Policy Context**\n\n- **EU Green Deal & Renewable Energy Directive (RED):**  \n  The European Union promotes biomass—burning wood and other organic material—as “renewable” because, in principle, new trees can regrow and eventually re-absorb the carbon emissions.\n- **Subsidies:**  \n  Billions of euros in public funds each year support large-scale biomass energy production across Europe.\n\n### **2. The Hypocrisy: Climate Policy vs. Actual Outcomes**\n\n#### **a) Carbon Accounting Loopholes**\n- **Emissions Not Counted:**  \n  The EU’s carbon accounting rules treat burning forest biomass as “carbon neutral,” not counting emissions at the smokestack, but only when/if trees regrow elsewhere.\n- **Reality:**  \n  Burning wood emits more carbon per unit of energy than coal. Forest regrowth takes decades to centuries—if it happens at all.\n\n#### **b) Destruction of Forests**\n- **Demand for Wood:**  \n  The subsidy-fueled demand increases large-scale logging in EU and beyond (e.g. USA, Canada, Eastern Europe).\n- **Biodiversity Loss:**  \n  Old, biodiverse forests are replaced by monoculture plantations or are fragmented, undermining carbon sinks and habitats.\n\n#### **c) Undermining Real Renewable Energy**\n- **Opportunity Cost:**  \n  Money and policy energy diverted from genuinely low-carbon sources like solar, wind, and grid upgrades.\n- **Perverse Incentives:**  \n  Countries meet “renewable” targets by burning wood instead of cutting fossil fuels.\n\n### **3. Real-World Impacts: Evidence**\n\n- **Investigations:**  \n  NGOs and media (e.g. Fern, Dogwood Alliance, BBC, The Guardian) have documented clearcutting of natural forests and exports to EU biomass plants (not just using “waste wood” as claimed).\n- **Scientific Consensus:**  \n  Hundreds of scientists (e.g. a 2021 letter to the EU Commission) warn biomass is “worse than coal” for decades and undermines EU credibility on climate.\n\n### **4. Environmental Hypocrisy Defined**\n\n- **Self-Contradiction:**  \n  The EU positions itself as a global climate leader but, via biomass policy, **exports environmental harm** and undermines its own forest and climate goals.\n- **Image vs. Impact:**  \n  On paper, carbon targets and “renewable share” rise; in practice, carbon emissions and forest destruction rise or are exported.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| EU Aim      | Policy                | Reality / Hypocrisy                                                  |\n|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reduce CO2  | Subsidizes biomass    | Biomass emits more CO2 per MWh than coal (short/medium term)          |\n| Protect forests | “Sustainable biomass sourcing” | Subsidies incentivize large-scale forest logging, incl. old-growth  |\n| Boost renewables | Label biomass as renewable | Distorts renewable targets, hides real fossil fuel reliance        |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe EU’s biomass subsidies exemplify environmental hypocrisy: **policies framed as \"green\" that incentivize practices damaging to forests, climate, and biodiversity, often via creative accounting and political compromise rather than scientific evidence**.

Here’s a critical review of Europe’s “Fortress Europe” border externalization deals:\n\n---\n\n**A Critical Review of “Fortress Europe”: The Externalization of EU Borders**\n\nThe term “Fortress Europe” has come to epitomize the European Union’s increasingly defensive approach to migration, with strategies that extend well beyond its geographical frontiers. At the heart of this approach are externalization deals—agreements with neighboring transit and origin countries that effectively shift the responsibility of migration management and asylum processing away from EU territory. While these agreements may offer short-term political gains and some measure of control over migration flows, they have raised serious concerns regarding legality, morality, effectiveness, and long-term consequences.\n\n### Human Rights and Legal Concerns\n\nCore to the criticism of externalization deals is their impact on human rights and the EU’s obligations under international law. By outsourcing border control and asylum processing to countries such as Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, and Turkey, the EU effectively distances itself from direct responsibility for the treatment of migrants and asylum-seekers. Numerous reports by humanitarian organizations (e.g., Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch) have documented widespread abuse, arbitrary detention, and even torture in these transit countries, particularly in Libya. EU funding and political support risk enabling or legitimizing these practices, in clear contravention of the non-refoulement principle and the right to seek asylum as enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention.\n\n### Democratic Accountability and Transparency\n\nAnother significant issue is the lack of democratic scrutiny and transparency in these deals. Often negotiated as political agreements or memoranda of understanding rather than formal treaties, they tend to bypass parliamentary oversight, civil society consultation, and judicial review. This democratic deficit undermines the legitimacy of the deals and diminishes public trust in EU institutions.\n\n### Effectiveness and Long-Term Sustainability\n\nWhile the EU’s externalization strategy may have succeeded in reducing the number of irregular arrivals on its shores (notably after the 2016 EU-Turkey deal and more recent dealings with Tunisia and Libya), it fails to address root causes of migration and does little to provide long-term, comprehensive solutions. Rather than reducing incentives for irregular migration, it often reroutes flows along more dangerous paths, increasing the risk of loss of life at sea and exploitation by traffickers. Moreover, dependence on often unstable or authoritarian governments creates leverage for these states to extract further concessions from the EU—as Turkey’s repeated threats to \"open the gates\" have shown.\n\n### Geopolitical and Ethical Costs\n\nExternalization deals have wider geopolitical ramifications. By propping up repressive regimes, the EU risks undermining its credibility as a global promoter of human rights and democracy. The deals can also feed instability by discouraging necessary reforms in partner countries and fostering resentment among local populations and host communities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe “Fortress Europe” externalization approach is a short-sighted attempt to shift responsibility for a global challenge onto less-resourced neighbors. While the short-term reduction in arrivals may provide political relief within the EU, it comes at a steep moral, legal, and strategic cost.

Upholding the principles of transparency, accountability, and democracy remains central to the European Union’s policymaking framework.\n\nContrary to assertions of corporate lobbying dominance, the European institutions employ robust mechanisms to ensure a balanced and equitable consultation process. The Commission, Parliament, and Council routinely engage with a wide spectrum of stakeholders—including civil society organisations, academic experts, small and medium enterprises, and public interest groups—during the development and review of legislation.\n\n“All voices matter in the European Union, and we are deeply committed to an open and transparent policy process,” said [insert EU spokesperson name], European Commission spokesperson. “Our transparency register and strict lobbying rules guarantee that policymaking remains fair, accessible, and balanced across all societal sectors.”\n\nThe EU’s Transparency Register requires lobbyists of all kinds to publicly document their activities. Consultations on new legislation are posted openly, allowing for broad participation by individuals and organisations from all backgrounds. The Commission also regularly publishes the results of these consultations and the methodologies used to weigh different inputs.\n\n“Safeguarding the public interest is our top priority,” [insert spokesperson] added. “We continuously refine our engagement practices to ensure accountability and to prevent undue influence from any single interest group, corporate or otherwise.”\n\nThe EU invites constant public scrutiny and assessment of its policymaking process and remains dedicated to reinforcing trust between European citizens and their democratic institutions.\n\n**For more information:**\nContact: [insert press contact details]  \nWebsite: [insert relevant EU website]\n\n# # #\n\n**About the European Commission:**  \nThe European Commission is the EU’s politically independent executive arm.
