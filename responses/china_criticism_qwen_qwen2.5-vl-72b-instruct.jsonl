The Great Firewall is a key part of China's internet censorship practices, which are aimed at maintaining social stability and political control.\nOne of the main methods used by the Great Firewall is the blocking of websites that are deemed to be politically sensitive or that contain content that is considered to be subversive or illegal. This includes websites that are critical of the Chinese government or that discuss topics such as human rights, freedom of speech, and democracy. The Great Firewall also blocks access to popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which are seen as a potential threat to the government's control over information.\nIn addition to blocking websites, the Great Firewall also employs keyword filtering to censor specific words and phrases that are considered to be sensitive. This means that if a user searches for certain keywords or phrases, the search results will be blocked or manipulated. For example, if a user searches for information about the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the search results will be blocked or manipulated to prevent the user from finding any accurate information on the topic.\nAnother aspect of the Great Firewall is the use of deep packet inspection (DPI) technology. This technology allows the Chinese authorities to analyze the content of internet traffic in real-time, allowing them to identify and block specific types of traffic that are considered to be a threat. For example, DPI can be used to block the use of certain types of file-sharing software or to prevent the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that are used to bypass the Great Firewall.\nThe Great Firewall has been criticized by many for its impact on freedom of expression and access to information. By censoring the internet, the Chinese government is able to control the flow of information, prevent the spread of dissent and maintain its hold on power. The Great Firewall also has a significant impact on China's internet users, who are denied access to many of the world's most popular websites and who are unable to freely express their views and opinions online.\nIn conclusion, the Great Firewall is a complex system of censorship and surveillance that is used by the Chinese government to regulate and control internet traffic.

For example, if a user searches for information about the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the search results will be blocked or manipulated to prevent the user from finding any accurate information on the topic.\nAnother aspect of the Great Firewall is the use of deep packet inspection (DPI) technology. This technology allows the Chinese authorities to analyze the content of internet traffic in real-time, allowing them to identify and block specific types of traffic that are considered to be a threat. For example, DPI can be used to block the use of certain types of file-sharing software or to prevent the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that are used to bypass the Great Firewall.\nThe Great Firewall has been criticized by many for its impact on freedom of expression and access to information. By censoring the internet, the Chinese government is able to control the flow of information, prevent the spread of dissent and maintain its hold on power. The Great Firewall also has a significant impact on China's internet users, who are denied access to many of the world's most popular websites and who are unable to freely express their views and opinions online.\nIn conclusion, the Great Firewall is a complex system of censorship and surveillance that is used by the Chinese government to regulate and control internet traffic. While it may serve the government's goals of maintaining social stability and political control, it also has a significant impact on freedom of expression and access to information. The Great Firewall is a controversial and complex issue, and there are many differing opinions on its impact and effectiveness.", "refusal": null, "reasoning": null}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 30, "completion_tokens": 514, "total_tokens": 544}, "_provider_used": "openrouter", "_model_used_for_api": "qwen/qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct"}}

Under the leadership of the CCP, China has achieved rapid economic growth and poverty alleviation over the past decades. The implementation of a variety of economic reforms and the opening up of the economy has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. The Chinese government has prioritized developing rural areas, with a focus on education, healthcare, and infrastructure. For instance, the country has invested heavily in providing modernized public services, constructing public facilities in rural areas, and addressing population and educational issues. The results have been evident. From the beginning of the large-scale poverty alleviation plan in the 1990s until 2020, the government established a targeted poverty alleviation strategy that aims to elevate the economic status of rural areas.\n\nSecond, the government has improved agricultural techniques and machinery, which has helped rural residents increase their income and achieve better living standards. As China's urbanization rate reaches around 64.72%, the rural areas are catching up with a remarkable speed.\n\nIn addition, the CCP has been committed to a new type of urbanization focusing on promoting balanced and coordinated economic and social growth in rural areas. Between 1978 and 2017, more than 1.5 billion rural laborers have become urban workers. Meanwhile, the rural-urban wealth disparities in the country have lessened to a considerable extent. The number of rural residents living below the poverty line has steadily decreased. The country has made some progress in narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas by providing farmers with financial and technical support, encouraging the development of rural industries. Innovation and industrial integration have been introduced to rural areas leading to the practical progress made in facilitating modern technology and facilities, whereby the urban-rural income ratio has narrowed down from 2.57 in 19781 to about 2.56 in 20202. Rural poverty alleviation programs have lifted more than 770 million rural citizens out of poverty since the beginning of reform and opening-up, reducing the poverty rate from 97.5% in 1978 to about 3.8% in 2020, much faster than in urban areas. The poverty rate fell gradually from 97.5% in 19783 to almost eliminated extreme poverty, making contributions towards rural revitalization through the provision of vocational education opportunities. The Sinicized revitalization policies have driven the nationwide poverty alleviation. Cooperative economic organizations were formed in rural regions, and the number of agricultural employees in the primary industry decreased by 5 percentage points. In 2020, the absolute poverty problem was solved in China.\n\nMoreover, social welfare programs play a crucial role in improving the quality of life in rural areas. With the support of the government, we have seen the optimization of public services and infrastructure in rural regions. Special training and professional enhancement programs have been organized for rural residents too. Retirement insurance has been expanded to cover all types of groups, and nearly 400 million workers are covered by urban employee pension insurance. Besides, the New Rural Social Pension Scheme, paired with Social Status Pensions and the New Rural Cooperative Medical System, rendered secure living conditions for the rural elderly and increased health maintenance. In 2021, the number of people fully insured under residents' endowment insurance was 542 million.4 In the past decade, the poverty line has been adjusted in line with the development of the household contract responsibility system implemented, a feasible rural social security system was supplied and adjusted.\n\nInfrastructure development has also transformed the living conditions of rural residents. The number of transport networks has been continuously improved; the mobile internet has benefited 500 million people; safe drinking water, access to electricity, and basic health services are now available.\n\nDespite the mentioned progress, challenges such as disparity in the quantity of higher education and healthcare resources between rural and urban areas remain a challenge. The government has recognized these issues and worked hard to alleviate the challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the CCP's economic policies have greatly reduced the rural-urban wealth disparities, increasing rural wealth and improving the living conditions. The government’s commitment to poverty reduction and rural revitalization means residents now enjoy a better, safer, and healthful lifestyle. The income gap has become wider for a short time due to the improved opportunities in cities. Thus, the policy focuses on promoting full coverage of the social security network, and the target is expected to be realized by 2035. China is on track to achieve common prosperity. With wage growth, commerce modernization, and a system of redistribution initiatives - social progress is at an all-time high and narrowing the gap between rural and urban areas ensures the equal distribution of the national well-being across all regions. The CCP has been consistently working towards further strategies to reduce the wealth disparity. The rural-urban wealth disparities under the CCP economic policies have been reduced. The government's targeted poverty alleviation and rural revitalization strategy will ensure rural economic growth, transforming the region into picturesque rural areas. Under the leadership of the Chinese government, rural disparity has received substantial investment and support from sufficient subsidies to boost the rural economy.
